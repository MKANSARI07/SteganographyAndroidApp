Steganography Project
Introduction
This project focuses on the development of an Android application that implements steganography techniques to embed text within image and audio files. The primary aim is to enhance data privacy by providing a user-friendly solution for secure communication.

Definition of Steganography
Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other non-secret data, making it difficult to detect the presence of hidden messages.

Importance of Data Privacy
With increasing concerns about data security, steganography offers a method to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.

Overview of Techniques
Image-based Steganography: Utilizing methods like Least Significant Bit (LSB) to embed data in images.
Audio-based Steganography: Techniques such as LSB in WAV files and echo hiding to conceal information in audio files.
Literature Review
Image-based Techniques:
LSB Method
Vulnerabilities and adaptive techniques
Audio-based Techniques:
